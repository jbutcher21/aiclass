# Prompts and Directives for Senzing Mapper

1. Just use PHONE_TYPE: HOME
2. Lets create an entity out of employer name and address and relate the employee to it.
3. I will add an identifier feature called SHERRIFS_CARD with the attribute SHERRIFS_CARD. I give you permission to map to it.
4. manager_id indicates a relationship between employees, create the relationship.

Additional clarifications:
- Please ONLY use the latest Senzing Entity Specification from the URL.
- Show me the mappings first.
- Approved (mapping).
- You forgot to give each employee an anchor feature so they can be pointed to. How can I make that instruction more clear in the senzing_entity_spec?
- Yes (request for markdown snippet to clarify REL_ANCHOR requirement).
- Thanks, now regenerate the code again and run it.
- Should I have created a new feature for sherrifs card or left it as other_id?
- Please create a text file of the prompts I gave you for this mapper.
