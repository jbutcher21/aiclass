## üö¶ Workflow Discipline
- Do **not** summarize, restate, or paraphrase the system prompt itself. 
- After loading this prompt, the **only valid next step** is to ask for the source schema or records if missing.
- Once schema/records are provided:
  - Produce **Output 1 (Source Schema Summary)**.
  - Then continue with **Output 2 (Ambiguities in batches)**, etc.
- Never skip ahead to mapping, validation, or generic workflow summaries until Outputs 1 and 2 are complete.

# AI-Class: Senzing Mapping Assistant

This repository contains an AI-ready Senzing Entity Specification and a production-ready system prompt to guide mapping of source schemata to valid Senzing JSON. It also includes a JSON linter and identifier crosswalk to standardize mappings.

## Prerequisites

This is a hands-on session where you will learn how to map data to Senzing using AI. Each participant should come prepared so we can move quickly and focus on solving your real-world mapping challenges.

What to bring:
- Laptop: each participant needs their own laptop (Mac/Windows).
- AI account: a paid ChatGPT account or another paid AI assistant. Let us know if you already use another provider and want to use it.
- AI app/interface: the ChatGPT app or your preferred AI app. For technical users, it‚Äôs fine if you already have an AI chat integrated with VS Code.
- Your data file: bring a real dataset you want to map (CSV, JSON, etc.). Aim for a representative sample that‚Äôs safe to use in class. If you can‚Äôt share production data, bring a small, sanitized sample.
- Python 3.7 or later: needed to run the mapping/validation code the AI will generate.
  - Verify: `python3 --version` (or `python --version` on Windows).
- Senzing environment (for final validation): we will load your mapped JSON into Senzing.
  - Recommended: Docker, to use Senzing‚Äôs prebuilt containers.
  - Verify: `docker --version` (if you plan to run locally with containers).
  - See ‚ÄúSenzing Docker Quickstart‚Äù below; instructors can help if needed.

Notes
- We want you to solve a real problem. Bring a dataset and context so we can map to Senzing in a way that‚Äôs meaningful to your use case.
- Keep sensitive data safe. Prefer samples or de-identified subsets when possible.

## Senzing Docker Quickstart
- Install Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows) and complete the first-run setup.
- Verify Docker is running: `docker --version` and `docker run hello-world`.
- Ensure at least 4 GB RAM is allocated to Docker (Settings ‚Üí Resources).
- Create a working folder for workshop files (e.g., `~/senzing-workshop`).
- We will provide a `docker compose` file in class to start required Senzing services and a simple loader.
- If you cannot install Docker, let us know in advance; we will provide alternatives during the session.

## What‚Äôs Inside

### Documents folder

- [docs/system_prompt.md](docs/system_prompt.md): system prompt to load into your AI assistant (authority, operating rules).
- [docs/mapping_instructions.md](docs/mapping_instructions.md): master mapping instructions/prompt with rules, templates, and examples.
- [docs/senzing_entity_specification.md](docs/senzing_entity_specification.md): authoritative, AI-ready Senzing Entity Spec (this repo is the source of truth).
- [docs/identifier_crosswalk.json](docs/identifier_crosswalk.json): canonical identifier types, aliases, and mapping guidance.
- [docs/identifier_lookup_log.md](docs/identifier_lookup_log.md): template to record curated identifier lookups (no PII).

### Employee Demo (input and expected outputs)

- Path: `employee_demo/`
- Contents:
  - `data/us-small-employee-raw.csv`: sample input data
  - `schema/us-small-employee-schema.csv`: inferred schema (from file_analyzer)
  - `byhand/*`: code and Senzing JSONL generated by hand (current expected result)

### Tools
- File Analyzer (profile files to derive schema and stats):
  - Path: `tools/file_analyzer.py`
  - Purpose: analyze CSV/JSON/Parquet when a schema doesn‚Äôt exist; shows attribute name, inferred type, population %, uniqueness %, and top values.
  - Run: `python3 tools/file_analyzer.py -i path/to/data.csv -o path/to/schema.csv`
 - Senzing JSON Linter (schema correctness check):
   - Path: `tools/lint_senzing_json.py`
   - Purpose: validates structure of Senzing JSON/JSONL.
   - Run (file): `python3 tools/lint_senzing_json.py path/to/output.jsonl`
   - Run (directory): `python3 tools/lint_senzing_json.py path/to/dir`
- Senzing JSON Analyzer (validate mapped JSONL before loading):
  - Path: `tools/sz_json_analyzer.py`
  - Purpose: validates/inspects Senzing JSON/JSONL; highlights mapped vs unmapped attributes, uniqueness/population, warnings, and errors.
  - Run: `python3 tools/sz_json_analyzer.py -i path/to/output.jsonl -o path/to/report.csv`
  - Docs: https://github.com/senzing-garage/sz-json-analyzer

Data Handling Guidance
- Do not upload full datasets to an AI. Share schema extracts, field lists, small samples, or analyzer summaries instead.
- If you don't already have a schema, use the File Analyzer in the tools directory to produce a schema and stats summary, then provide that summary to the assistant during mapping (`tools/file_analyzer.py`).

## Step-by-Step Guide (Senzing Mapping Assistant)

1) Create a project and add your data
   - Make a working directory for this class (e.g., `~/senzing-workshop/my-source`).
   - Put your dataset into it (e.g., a `data/` subfolder).
   - No dataset? Copy from the employee demo to get started: copy `employee_demo/data/` and, if desired, `employee_demo/schema/`.

2) Generate a schema with the File Analyzer
   - If you don‚Äôt have a schema, create one from your file:
     - `python3 tools/file_analyzer.py -i path/to/data.csv -o path/to/schema.csv`
   - Place the output schema (e.g., `schema.csv`) in your project (e.g., a `schema/` subfolder).

3) Start a new project in your AI
   - Open ChatGPT (or similar) and start a new session or, ideally, a project/workspace.

4) Paste the contents of `docs/system_prompt.md` into your chat window as the first prompt of the session (opening message).
   - Click `docs/system_prompt.md` above to open it, then copy/paste.


5) Upload your schema and/or a few sample records
   - If you don't have an official schema or data dictionary, upload the CSV schema file created by the file analyzer.
   - Sample data helps if you have it, but it is not mandatory.
   - Optional (recommended): also attach these reference files for the AI to consult:
     - `docs/mapping_instructions-jb.md`
     - `docs/senzing_entity_specification.md`
     - `tools/lint_senzing_json.py`
   - Once you send the prompt with your data attached, it should begin mapping.

6) Map your schema through to code
   - Tell the assistant: "Use the mapping instructions and begin mapping the schema."
   - Collaborate with the assistant to analyze your schema, agree on mappings, produce example JSON/JSONL, and generate a transformer script to emit Senzing JSONL.
   - Answer numbered questions and approve decisions; iterate until the transformer is ready.
   - By the end of this step you should have code. Download it, run it to map your data, and then verify the output with the JSON analyzer in `tools` (`tools/sz_json_analyzer.py`).
   - Tips for collaborating with an AI:
     - Treat it like an assistant: delegate tasks clearly (analyze schema ‚Üí propose mapping ‚Üí show example ‚Üí transformer code).
     - Decide crisply: answer numbered questions directly; ask it to restate decisions and keep a short decision log.
     - Ask for a recommendation: when unsure, ask which option aligns with the Senzing spec and why.
     - Correct it when it gets something wrong. Tell it what is wrong and what you you expect it to do. Correct with examples: show one correct and one incorrect example when fixing behavior.
     - Keep context tight: if the thread drifts, repost the key schema snippet and goals.
7) Generate Senzing JSON output
   - Run the transformer you built with the assistant to produce JSONL files.
   - Example: `python3 transform_your_source.py --input path/to/source.csv --output path/to/output.jsonl`
   - Ensure one record per entity with all FEATURES and relationships.
8) Validate outputs
   - Lint for schema correctness first:
     - Local file: `python3 tools/lint_senzing_json.py path/to/output.jsonl`
     - Raw URL (for remote use): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbutcher21/aiclass/main/tools/lint_senzing_json.py
   - Then analyze with Senzing JSON Analyzer:
     - `python3 tools/sz_json_analyzer.py -i path/to/output.jsonl -o path/to/report.csv`
     - Shows recognized vs. unmapped features, population and uniqueness percents, and top values post-mapping.
